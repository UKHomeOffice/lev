Non-HMPO users can raise a ticket with their own Service Desk support,
who will contact the Home Office IT helpdesk.

Non-government users should contact contact the Home Office IT helpdesk directly
on 0845 000 0050 or by email at [ITnowServiceDesk@homeoffice.gov.uk](ITnowServiceDesk@homeoffice.gov.uk)
to report problems.

Triage will be performed by HMPO DSST L2 Support.  All calls should be assigned
to this team by the Service Desk and are dealt with in priority order.

### If that doesn't work
If you have not received a response within 5 working days, please forward the
issue to [lev-enquiries@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk](mailto:lev-enquiries@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk)
along with the ITNow Service Desk incident number.
